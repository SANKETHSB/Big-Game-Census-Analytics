This Big Game Census data visualization takes a fun look at where Super Bowl 52
players come from, the related population figures, and opens up pathways (via
embedded links) to additional census data points.

The dataset came about when two hapless data nerds had their teams eliminated from
the playoffs, thus turning to data to try to find more rooting interests for Super Bowl 52.
The rosters for both, competing teams are included, with the corresponding roster
information and birthplace and state population information. The developers utilized
census data pulled from census.gov, and roster information from Yahoo Sports, and
designed the data visualization within the Tableau platform.
